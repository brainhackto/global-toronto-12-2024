		"job": "Graduate student, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto",
	    "bio": "Navona’s thesis (Dr. Aristotle Voineskos) involved analyzing diffusion images from a large multisite dataset, collected on six MR scanners over five years. Making sense of the data was quite an adventure, and involved the systematic exploration of multiple preprocessing, harmonization, and white matter analysis methods. As part of a working group formed with others interested in diffusion imaging, she wrote a simple quality control algorithm that pulls from widely available image metrics and largely agrees with human raters. Navona has also contributed to a neuromelanin-sensitive imaging project (Dr. Yuliya Nikolova) that semi-automatically detects signal in brainstem nuclei."
