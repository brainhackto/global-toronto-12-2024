		"job": "Head of Whole Person Modelling, Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health\nAssistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto",
	    "bio": "Dr. Daniel Felsky is a scientist and educator broadly focused on the biostatistical modeling of both psychiatric and neurological illnesses, with specialized domain knowledge in Alzheimerâ€™s disease and human genomics. He has training in statistics, bioinformatics, and neuroimmunology and experience working with diverse data types including multi-modal structural MRI, human genetics, transcriptomics, longitudinal clinical assessments, and population-based health outcomes. He is most interested in the intersection of heritable and environmental risk for mental illness across the lifespan and modeling risk and prognosis as a product of all-cause factors using machine learning. Dr. Felsky currently leads a diverse group of trainees and staff with backgrounds in computer science, biology, medicine, and social sciences. Their group has a co-leadership role in multiple ongoing studies of clinical populations at CAMH and beyond, seeking to develop data-driven models that may improve clinical decision making. Dr. Felsky would like to engage even more broadly with the medical research community to understand where opportunities for impact are underdeveloped, to learn about real-world challenges of implementation science, and to offer insight into new collaborative projects where possible."
